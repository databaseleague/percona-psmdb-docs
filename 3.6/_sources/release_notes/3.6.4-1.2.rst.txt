|PSMDB| is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that is
a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 3.6 Community Edition.
It supports MongoDB 3.6 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends Community Edition functionality by including the
:ref:`inmemory` storage engine, as well as several enterprise-grade features.
Also it includes :ref:`mongorocks` storage engine, which is now deprecated.
|PSMDB| requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.6.4
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6/#apr-13-2018>`_
and provides the following additional changes:

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-205`: ``mongod`` failed to initialize if audit filter was
  set to record Action type events specified with the ``$in`` expression.

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-207`: a premature initialization of the feature compatibility
  version in global parameters was fixed for the RocksDB storage engine.

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-209`: CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 RPM packages contained config
  file with a wrong link to the online Percona Memory Engine documentation.

.. note:: As mentioned in the |PSMDB| 3.6.3-1.1 Release Notes, MongoRocks is
   deprecated in |PSMDB| 3.6.
