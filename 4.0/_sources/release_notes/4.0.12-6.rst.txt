================================================================================

Percona announces the release of |PSMDB| |release| on |date|. Download the
latest version from the `Percona website`_ or the `Percona software repositories`_.

|PSMDB| is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for |mongodb-ce|.  It supports |mongodb|
4.0 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends the functionality of the |mongodb-ce| by including the
:ref:`inmemory` storage engine, :ref:`encrypted WiredTiger storage
engine <psmdb.data-at-rest-encryption>`, :ref:`audit logging
<audit-log>`, :ref:`External LDAP Authentication with SASL
<ext-auth>`, :ref:`hot backups <hot-backup>`, and :ref:`enhanced query
profiling <rate-limit>`. |PSMDB| requires no changes to |mongodb|
applications or code.

|PSMDB| |release| enables uploading hot backups to an `Amazon S3
<https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ or a compatible storage service, such as `MinIO
<https://min.io/>`_. In this release, this feature has the *EXPERIMENTAL*
status. For more information, see the section
:ref:`psmdb-hot-backup-remote-destination` in the |PSMDB| documentation.

This release `includes all features
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0>`_ of |mongodb-ce|. Most
notable among these are:

- `Multi-Document ACID transactions
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#multi-document-transactions>`_
- `Type conversion through the new aggregation operators
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#new-type-conversion-operators>`_
- `Enhancements to the Change Streams support
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#database-and-deployment-change-streams>`_

Note that the `MMAPv1 storage engine is deprecated
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#deprecate-mmapv1>`_
in |mongodb-ce|.

|PSMDB| |release| is based on `MongoDB 4.0.12
